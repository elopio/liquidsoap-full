h2. Installing Savonet/Liquidsoap

You can install liquidsoap with OPAM (recommended), from source, or using a
package available for your distribution.

* "Using OPAM":#opam
* "From source":#source
* "Debian/Ubuntu":#deb
* "Windows":#win32
* "ArchLinux":#arch
* "Latest development version":#latest

h3@opam. Install using OPAM

The recommended method to install liquidsoap is by using the "OCaml Package
Manager":http://opam.ocaml.org/. OPAM is available in all major distributions
and on windows. We actively support the liquidsoap packages there and its
dependencies.

A typical installation with MP3 and Vorbis encoding/decoding and icecast support is done by executing:

%%
opam install taglib mad lame vorbis cry samplerate liquidsoap
%%

Most of liquidsoap's dependencies are only optionally installed by OPAM. For instance,
if you want to enable opus encoding and decoding after you've already installed liquidsoap, you should execute the following:

%%
opam install opus
%%

If your system is missing external dependencies for these optional features, OPAM may be
able to tell you which package to install. This can be acheived this way:

%%
opam install depext
opam depext taglib mad lame vorbis cry samplerate liquidsoap
%%

@opam info liquidsoap@ should give you the list of all optional dependencies that you may
enable in liquidsoap.

If you need to run liquidsoap as daemon, we provide a package named @liquidsoap-daemon@.
See "savonet/liquidsoap-daemon":https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-daemon for more information.

Using OPAM, you can also install liquidsoap or any of its dependencies from source. For instance:

%%
git clone --recursive https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap.git
cd liquidsoap
opam pin add liquidsoap .
%%

Most dependencies should be compatible with OPAM pinning. Let us know if you find one that isn't!

When using OPAM for the first time, you should run

%%
opam init
%%

and answer <code>y</code> (for _yes_) to the question it asks, about whether you
want OPAM to modify some configuration files (this will put the directory where
Liquidsoap in your path).

h3@source. Installing from source

You can download source code published by Savonet from the "github releases
page":https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases.

The recommended way for newcomers is to use the liquidsoap-full-xxx.tar.gz
tarball. This tarball includes all required OCaml bindings and allows you to
compile and install liquidsoap in a single @configure@, @make@ and @make
install@ procedure. You will still need the corresponding C libraries and their
development files, though.

You will then have to "build the source":doc-dev/build.html.

h3@deb. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Liquidsoap is included in Debian and Ubuntu distributions:

* "Debian packages":http://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap
* "Ubuntu packages":http://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap

h3@win32. Windows

We do not maintain windows build for liquidsoap anymore. See "this page":windows.html for instructions on how to build it yourself.

h3@arch. ArchLinux

A package for Arch Linux users is available from the distribution,
see the "ArchLinux Liquidsoap package page":https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/liquidsoap/

h3@latest. Git repository (and other distributions)

If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the git repository.
To get a copy of it, you have to run:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-full.git liquidsoap
cd liquidsoap
make init
</pre>

After, that you have to create a list of modules that you want to compile. A
good starting point is to do

<pre>
cp PACKAGES.minimal PACKAGES
</pre>

and edit the @PACKAGES@ file to uncomment the libraries you are interested in.
You should then run the configuration scripts by

<pre>
./bootstrap
./configure
</pre>

and finally build Liquidsoap:

<pre>
make
</pre>

After that, you should synchronize the repository from time to time using

<pre>
make update
</pre>

Some more explanations can be found in the "build instructions":doc-dev/build.html.
