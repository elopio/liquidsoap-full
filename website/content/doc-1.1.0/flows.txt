We maintain a
"webpage of streams generated by Liquidsoap":http://flows.liquidsoap.info/.
In order to register your radio on this page, a simple
operator called @register_flow@ is provided. If your stream is called @stream@,
just wrap it as follows before outputting it:

%%
stream = register_flow(
  radio="My radio",
  website="http://my.web.site/",
  description="The sound of my computer",
  genre="reggae",
  user="foo",
  password="bar",
  streams=[("mp3/128k","http://my.web.site/stream")],
  stream)
%%

Most parameters are pretty explicit: @radio@ is the name of the radio,
@website@ is the url of the website of the radio, etc.

The parameter @streams@ is a list of pairs of strings describing the format of the
stream and the url of the stream. We use a list here because one radio can be
broadcasted under multiple stream formats. The format should always be of the
form @codec/bitrate@ (e.g. @mp3/128k@) or @codec@ if it is encoded in variable
bitrate.

You can register a stream with any @user@ and @password@ parameters.
Those parameters are only useful if you use additional services such as the 
command-line client, or if you want to claim that you "own" a registered radio.
All this is relatively informal for now, but may be tightened in future
developments of Flows.
